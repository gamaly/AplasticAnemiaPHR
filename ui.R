This upward trend resulted in an assessment that Aplastic Anemia was unlikely. However, bivariate regression analysis of WBCs and Prednisone intake shows a statistically significant correlation (P < .001) and an R Squared of .38. Accounting for 38% of the variance in WBC counts per day, the model predicts an increase of .032 (K/uL) WBCs for every additional 1mg of Prednisone. The linear model does not currently account for infusions."),

From January - April, Prednisone accounted for greater than 60% of the variance. However, the increased number of medications while inpatient at NIH appear to have reduced the direct effectiveness of Prednisone on WBCs."),
